Let  us  now  briefly  consider  the  steps  by  which  domestic races have been
either from one or from several allied species. Some little effect may, perhaps,
attributed  to  the  direct  action of the external conditions of life, and some
to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for  the
of  a  dray  and  race  horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler
One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see  in
adaptation,  not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or
Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly,  or  by  one  step;
botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which
be rivalled by any mechanical  contrivance,  is  only  a  variety  of  the  wild
and  this  amount  of  change  may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has
been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been  the  case  with  the
sheep.  But  when  we  compare  the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and
the various breeds of sheep  fitted  either  for  cultivated  land  or  mountain
with  the  wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for
purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each  good  for  man  in  very
ways;  when  we  compare  the  game-cock,  so pertinacious in battle, with other
so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting layers" which never desire to sit,  and
the  bantam  so  small  and  elegant;  when we compare the host of agricultural,
orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most  useful  to  man  at  different
and  for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look
than to mere variability. We cannot suppose that all the  breeds  were  suddenly
as  perfect  and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know
this has not been  their  history.  The  key  is  man's  power  of  accumulative
nature  gives  successive  variations;  man  adds  them up in certain directions
to him. In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds.
